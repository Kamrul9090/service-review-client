                        Difference between SQL and NoSQL

                        When it comes to choosing a database the biggest decisions is picking a relational (SQL) or non-relational (NoSQL) data structure. While both the databases are viable options still there are certain key differences between the two that users must keep in mind when making a decision.
                        <p>
                            There are five practical differences between SQL and NoSQL:

                        What is JWT? and how does it work?

                    </h1>
                    <p>
                        JWT, or JSON Web Token, is an open standard used to share security information between two parties â€” a client and a server.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        JWTs differ from other web tokens in that they contain a set of claims. Claims are used to transmit information between two parties. What these claims are depends on the use case at hand. For example, a claim may assert who issued the token, how long it is valid for, or what permissions the client has been granted

                        How does NodeJS handle multiple requests at the same time?
                    </h1>
                    <p>
                        NodeJS receives multiple client requests and places them into EventQueue. NodeJS is built with the concept of event-driven architecture. NodeJS has its own EventLoop which is an infinite loop that receives requests and processes them.
